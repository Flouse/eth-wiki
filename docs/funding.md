# Sources of Funding

## Ethereum Foundation Grants

Opaque process. Low information. Long decision cycles.

Other than the Grants model, the EF does contract people outside of the Grants process directly from time to time.

Initial short term funding for Working Groups might evolve into a repeatable model.

## MolochDAO

Need to ragequit to get funds out.

## Ethereum Community Fund

As of this writing, it's unclear that they have funds to disburse. Didn't have money as of some time in Q4 2018

## Gitcoin Grants

Limited success in funding large / long term projects. A bit of a popularity contest, teams need to spend time promoting / have someone on team who is good at promotion to get results.
