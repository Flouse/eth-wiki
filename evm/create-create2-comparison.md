<!-- TITLE: CREATE vs. CREATE2 Comparison -->

The CREATE2 is scheduled to be part of the [Constantinople](https://en.ethereum.wiki/roadmap#constantinople) / Petersburg upgrade. It is defined as [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014).

There is a lot of discussion around what it enables, and how it compares to the CREATE opcode it improves on. This page will bring together the documentation in one place.
