Prior information is available on the [releases](/releases) page.

The formal process of hardforks is documented in [EIP 233](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-233), along with some recent discussion on [EthMagicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eep-5-ethereum-hardfork-process-request-for-collaboration/2305).

The [ETH1](/eth1) page lists Working Groups and areas of focus.

# Constantinople
Constantinople is planned for Q1 of 2019. Planned date was originally January 16th, 2019, 12:00pm UTC. Now will activate February 25th, 2019, at the same time as [Petersburgh](/roadmap/petersburgh), which de-activates EIP-1283.

# Next Timelines

## Cheesy Hardfork 6 Month Schedule
Current discussion is on moving towards a 6-month cycle. [Danno is leading discussion on a Cheesy Hardfork Schedule](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/28)

* "Asiago" April 2020
* "Brie" October 2020

_Note: We are **not** using cheese names, they are annoying on purpose to force us to choose new names as part of the hardfork meta creation process!_
# ETH 1.x
There are a variety of proposals for what is now known as ETH 1.x -- a series of upgrades to add features in support of the full ETH2 specs. These are all at the proposal / discussion stage, without any of them having been turned into EIPs.

The [EthMagicians ETH 1.x Ring](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/ethereum-1-x-ring) has more discussions.

## Meetings

# Serenity / ETH2
See the [ETH2 Specs Github Repo](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs).

The [ETH2 Project Management repo](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm) holds ongoing notes and meetings.
