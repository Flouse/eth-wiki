## External Contributor example

* Name Surname, Github username, email@domain and/or other contact methods.

(An email or other contact methods are optional, but preferred in case you have set a no-reply public Github email address, or if your Github account is deleted. However, to prevent spam and too many emails, you may prefer to list public contact methods such as your Twitter username and your website.)
