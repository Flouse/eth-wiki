## Geth Consensus Bug

> On 2016-11-24, a consensus bug occurred due to two implementations having different behavior in the case of state reverts. [3](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/25/security-alert-11242016-consensus-bug-geth-v1-4-19-v1-5-2/). The specification was amended to clarify that empty account deletions are reverted when the state is reverted... Details: Geth was failing to revert empty account deletions when the transaction causing the deletions of empty accounts ended with an an out-of-gas exception. An additional issue was found in Parity, where the Parity client incorrectly failed to revert empty account deletions in a more limited set of contexts involving out-of-gas calls to precompiled contracts; the new Geth behavior matches Parityâ€™s, and empty accounts will cease to be a source of concern in general in about one week once the state clearing process finishes.
