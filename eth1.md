<!-- TITLE: Ethereum 1x -->

This is the current "version" of Ethereum. [EthHub has extensive information and background on ETH1x](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-1.x/).

You may also want to review the [roadmap](/roadmap), or view [all Eth1 pages](/eth1/all).
# Working Groups
A list of current working groups focused on core research, upgrades, and challenges.

## State Rent
Implementing state rent to address

* Leads: Alexey Akhunov

## Finality Gadget
Using the ETH2 beacon chain to finalize ETH1 blocks.

* Leads: ?
* Alexey's [presentation slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16KLZKAutK79NxMh8L7B6hpNKuoOaAPZT) and [video](https://youtu.be/HaT-BIzWSew?t=24502)
* EthMagicians Thread https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/finality-gadget-for-ethereum1x-working-group/3177

Alexey is interested in seeing this happen, but doesn't have the bandwidth to lead this Working Group. Please comment in the EthMagicians thread if you want to get involved.

## VM & Precompiles

### Precompiles
There is no working group focused specifically on precompiles, but there are discussion groups for at least one proposal (e.g. [elliptic curve linear combinations](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/precompile-for-general-elliptic-curve-linear-combinations/2581)).

### Ewasm
Building a spec for Ethereum-flavoured WebAssembly (wasm) and determining what might go into ETH1x vs. preparing for ETH2.

### EVM Evolution

Improvements to the current EVM around speed, safety, and interoperability. Safety improvements will increase the capabilities of static analysis and formal verification tools operating on EVM. Interoperability improvements include making EVM a better code generation target for higher-level languages like Solidity and Vyper, as well as lower-level bytecode formats such as WebAssembly/Ewasm and LLVM IR. Also helping form long-term plans for EVM across the ETH1x and ETH2 roadmaps.

* Leads: Brooke Zelenka, Greg Colvin
# Initiatives
Smaller initiatives around core systems and processes, calls for collaboration.

## Hardfork Cadence

* Leads: Danno
* See https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/28

# Infrastructure
Ongoing infrastructure focus areas for coordinating work & support on the core network.

## Testing
* Leads: Zak, Dmitry, wtf

### Consensus Testing

* Leads: Dmitry

# Meetings
