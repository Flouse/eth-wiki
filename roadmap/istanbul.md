# Discussion
## Proposed: Security Review Period
Should we add a security review period? Let's say 4 weeks needed minimum once people responsible for review have the EIPs available, so maybe 2019-06-21 for first security review / reports? [Discuss on EthMagicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/security-review-period-for-hardfork-roadmap/2721)
