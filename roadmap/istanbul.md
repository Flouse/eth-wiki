**Going forward, the list of [EIPs in 1679](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679) are the canonical status of EIPs**

This will be maintained as an overview page, can also view the [Istanbul GitHub Project in the ECH repo](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-cat-herders/projects/2) to track progress.
