<!-- TITLE: Istanbul -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: October 2019 Planned Ethereum Network Upgrade -->

# Timelines
Afri proposed the [following schedule on the Jan 4th All Core Devs call](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/66#issuecomment-450840440) where it was provisionally accepted. That same thread has a lot of push for [ProgPoW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW), an ASIC resistant mining algorithm change. There is ongoing discussion about a pre-Istanbul hardfork to include this.

* 2019-01-16 (Wed) projected date for mainnet network upgrade ([“Constantinople”](/roadmap#constantinople))
	* Note: updated dates / links re: Constantinople re-schedule to 2019-02-27 need to be included (aka ["Petersburg"](/roadmap/petersburg))
* 2019-05-17 (Fri) hard deadline to accept proposals for “Istanbul”
* 2019-07-19 (Fri) soft deadline for major client implementations
* 2019-08-14 (Wed) projected date for testnet network upgrade (Ropsten, Görli, or ad-hoc testnet)
* 2019-10-16 (Wed) projected date for mainnet upgrade (“Istanbul”)

# Proposals
[EIP 1679](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679) is the Istanbul Hardfork tracking Meta EIP.

* [EIP 1829](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1829) Precompile for Elliptic Curve Linear Combinations.
* [EIP 615](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-615) Static Jumps and Subroutines
* [EIP 1057](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1057) ProgPoW, a Programmatic Proof-of-Work

_Follow along All Core Dev calls and the [EIPs repo](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs)._

# Discussion

## Proposed: In Person ETH1x April Meeting

[Timing for in person meeting before May 17th hard deadline for proposals. April?](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eth1x-istanbul-prep-meeting/2396)

## Proposed: Security Review Period
Should we add a security review period? Let's say 4 weeks needed minimum once people responsible for review have the EIPs available, so maybe 2019-06-21 for first security review / reports? [Discuss on EthMagicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/security-review-period-for-hardfork-roadmap/2721)
