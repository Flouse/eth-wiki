<!-- TITLE: Istanbul -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: October 2019 Planned Ethereum Hardfork -->

# Timelines
Afri proposed the [following schedule on the Jan 4th All Core Devs call](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/66#issuecomment-450840440) where it was provisionally accepted. That same thread has a lot of push for [ProgPoW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW), an ASIC resistant mining algorithm change. There is ongoing discussion about a pre-Istanbul hardfork to include this.

* 2019-01-16 (Wed) projected date for mainnet-hardfork ([“Constantinople”](/roadmap#constantinople))
* 2019-05-17 (Fri) hard deadline to accept proposals for “Istanbul”
* 2019-07-19 (Fri) soft deadline for major client implementations
* 2019-08-14 (Wed) projected date for testnet-hardfork (Ropsten, Görli, or ad-hoc testnet)
* 2019-10-16 (Wed) projected date for mainnet-hardfork (“Istanbul”)
